# Scheduler
  This app is an organizational tool consisting of a event manager, calendar, and note pad. This tool is too help me 
track bugs in my other software endeavors, and daily life.

# OVERVIEW
  Scheduler is an event tracking and time planning program which strives to help users manage their yearly, monthly, 
and weekly management. Scheduler helps store, and display information that the user has communicated with the 
program with the aid of SQL. This program allows users to construct events, upcoming events are displayed on the 
home screen and shown on the calendar page. Scheduler also allows users to write note entries into the program to
provide additional information related to an event, or subject. Scheduler has an amazing, sleek and intuitive
design with powerful backend support.

  - ColorHandle    - 1.5 Hours

# PLANS
  Scheduler has seen many significant changes through its early life. Upcoming ideas consist of adding a “Folder” 
system, which would allow users to compile a multitude of events, into a folder. Correspondingly, these events 
may be connected with a note thus when an event is selected from a folder the contents of the connected note will 
be displayed. This should allow the user a next level of organization in regards to planning events, and handling
notes.

# WHAT I'VE LEARNED
  Scheduler was a fun program to design and create. Even though C++ basic form design is extremely limited, and 
dated, I managed to create an appealing looking app. The Calendar form helped me gain a better understanding of
how the time API can be utilized in a simple, and efficient manner to create a powerful Calendar program. I also 
learned a little about SQL datatypes, especially in regards to using operators to search and locate information. 
Such as text using the ‘Like” clause, and VARCHARS using the = operator. I have learned how conflicting it is to
create a readable, and structured SQL class. It would save me a lot of code to have SQL functions in many classes
like Events List, Calendar and Notebook programs, however, this would break the MVC model, as these classes would
now have to deal with SQL commands. But, by not breaking this model there is a lot of code which can be condensed.
